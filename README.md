A balanced fold, also called tree fold, is an operation of folding a list of values using some associative operation, trying as much as possible to balance.

Can be useful for constructing balanced binary trees, or more stable summation.

# Example

Given a binary tree,

```purescript
data T a = Empty | L a | B (T a) (T a)

infixl 6 B as :*:
```

which is an instance of `Semigroup` with `append = B` and `Monoid` with `mempty = Empty`,

```purescript
balancedFold (map L (1..5)) â‰¡ ((L 1) :*: (((L 2) :*: (L 3)) :*: ((L 4) :*: (L 5))))
```
